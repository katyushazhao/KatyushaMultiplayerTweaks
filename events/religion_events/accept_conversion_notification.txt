# Everything outcommented, bevause overwriting an event only partly is not supported by the game. I would need to replace the whole religious_interaction_events.txt file for it to work properly
# (currently it works 50% of the times and other modders told me it even might cause crashes and other problems when I do not overwrite it fully)
# So I outcomment this, because overwriting the whole event is no option, it makes it much too incomptaible to game updates and other mods.
